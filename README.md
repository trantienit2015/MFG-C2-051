# MFG-C2-051 — Equipment Maintenance KB & Technician Q&A Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (multi-step domain workflow)
> **Industry**: MFG

## Overview

Answers maintenance technicians' questions about equipment from a manual
knowledge base, with citations back to the source passages.

The pipeline normalizes and validates the incoming technician query, runs hybrid
retrieval over the manual knowledge base (dense similarity combined with keyword
matching, which matters because maintenance queries carry part numbers and error
codes that pure vector search handles poorly), generates an answer grounded in the
retrieved passages with citations attached, and then validates that the answer is
actually supported by those passages before returning it.

Answers that cannot be grounded are flagged rather than presented as fact, and
risk-bearing procedures are marked. A language model is used for answer generation
when one is supplied through configuration; without it the agent returns the
retrieved passages and citations, so the template runs end to end without an API
key.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design specification and test specification
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design specification and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the
test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
